# Student Directory

## Overview

This is a student directory app with React. It demonstrates breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

## User Story

* As a teacher, I want to be able to view my entire student directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

A teacher would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about the students. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of students should render.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by first or last name
  
  * Hover over a thumbnail to view larger photo

  * Filter the users by state
